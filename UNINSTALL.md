# Save-The-Session
Lightweight chrome extension for just saving the session, and re-loading it later.

Hey, You were redirected here because it looks like you unistalled Save-The-Session,
hopefully by mistake.

##Why are you seeing this sad Github page?

Well thats because I don't have a server that hosts this extension or tracks your information.

**Neither is that going to happen anytime**. You see, I don't have the means or the will to collect 
your information and present you with wonderful promotional offers and not give the 
**furry crack of rat's behind** about your privacy.

If the uninstallation was not a mistake, you are always welcome to put forward your suggestions
and any features you would like to see in Save-The-Session in the future.
#####Just shoot a mail to: **george.shibin1993@gmail.com**

#####Thanks for trying out Save-The-Session !!

###May the force be with you
